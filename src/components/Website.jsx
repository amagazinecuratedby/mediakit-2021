            component and a dynamic creative news section. Each issue of A
            MAGAZINE <span className="italic">curated by</span> has its
            dedicated page where the theme of the magazine and its contributors
            are presented alongside the table of contents and visual excerpts.

            perspective to current events and stories taking place in fashion,
            art and incidental creative fields, as well as our curators,
            contributors and supporting brands and partners, offering a
            distinctive outlook and insightful angle on outreached spaces and
            unexplored topics.
