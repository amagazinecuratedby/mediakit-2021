            is a multiÂ­service platform that encapsulates an archival collection
            component and a dynamic creative news section. Each issue of A
            MAGAZINE <span className="italic">curated by</span> has its
            dedicated page where the theme of the magazine and its contributors
            are presented alongside pictures and visual references. Our
            collection of A PROJECT
            <span className="italic">curated by</span> will soon be accessible
            on this space too.
          </p>
          <p>
            The news section invites regular contributors to extend our curated
            perspective to current events and stories taking place in fashion,
            art and incidental creative fields, as well as our curators,
            contributors and supporting brands and partners, offering a
            distinctive outlook and insightful angle on outreached spaces and
            unexplored topics.
